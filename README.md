# PanoViewer #

a small panoramic image viewer for equirectangular projections written
in C++ using OpenGL. Projection is done directly in the fragment shader
on the GPU, and it uses a tiling method to be able to load large images
that exceed the maximum size of a texture on the graphics card.

## Dependencies ##

PanoViewer depends on GLEW <http://glew.sourceforge.net/> and GLFW 3 <http://www.glfw.org/> for platform independent OpenGL and libjpeg <http://www.ijg.org/> for loading jpg's.

Libjpeg is statically included in the code, just put the content of
jpegsr<x>.zip from the IJG in the "libjpeg" subdirectory before running
CMake
